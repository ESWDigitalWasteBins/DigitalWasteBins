# ESW Digital Waste Bins

A Python project that links each bin to a screen showing:
  1. Landfill
  2. Compost
  3. Recycle

Active:
  - Compost: show possible things to put in that bin, cycles through it every 3-5 seconds
  - Recycle: cups/cans
  - Landfill: straws/wrappers
  - Show diagram of what goes into which bin? (Starbucks cup: straw goes in landfill, cup goes into compost, etc.)

Interactive:
  - Display Co2 equivalent emissions: Thanks for throwing out __ oz of __.
  - IDEAL: scan what is being thrown in and if it's correct
